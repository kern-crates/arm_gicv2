//! Software Generated Interrupt Register, GICD_SGIR
//! The GICD_SGIR characteristics are:
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! Controls the generation of SGIs.
//!
//! ## Usage constraints
//!
//! It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the GICD_SGIR has any effect when the forwarding of interrupts by Distributor is disabled by
//! the GICD_CTLR settings.
//!
//! ## Configurations
//!
//! This register is available in all configurations of the GIC. If the GIC implements the Security Extensions this register is Common.
//!
//! The NSATT field, bit [15], is implemented only if the GIC implements the Security Extensions.
